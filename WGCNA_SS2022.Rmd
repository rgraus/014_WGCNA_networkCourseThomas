# What is Gene Co-expression Analysis ?


## The ratio behind co-expression analysis

- Genes act in cooperation and not individually
- These cooperating units can be viewed as modules of genes
- Pathways are a subtype of modules, but cross pathway communication is largely a terra icognita → using modules may overcome this shortcoming.
- Network based methods instead of reporting a list of individual parts are a natural approach to understanding such a “system”.
- Focus on modules as opposed to individual genes → this greatly alleviates multiple testing problem


## What is a Gene Regulatory Network ?

![Gene regulatory network](Images/GRN.png)

## A few network concepts - network types

A network or graph is a pair (V,E), where V is a set of vertices (or nodes) and E is a set of edges connecting the vertices

![Types of networks](Images/networktypes.png)

(A) represents a directed network, (B) an undirected network, and (C) represents a weighted network with edge weight represented by edge thickness.

# Network concepts

## Z transformation

- Formula: $z=\frac{x-\overline{x}}{s}$

- Transforms a dataset into a gaussian distribution (mean = zero, standard deviation = 1)

- Enables the comparison between values of different distributions and locations: mean +/- 2s ~ p-value of < 0.05 → quick‘n dirty test for statistical significance

- We will use the prefix „z“ as denominator of z-transformed values

## Adjacency

The adjacecy is a measure how strongly two nodes are connected.

In co-expression networks, correlations are often used to construct an adjacency matrix:

- unsigned $a_{ij} = |cor(x_i, x_j)|^\beta$

- signed $a_{ij} = |0.5+0.5cor(x_i, x_j)|^\beta$

## Scale free topology

In a scale free network the degree function follows

$$P(k) \sim K^\lambda$$

That means that there are 

- few highly connected nodes 
- many less connected nodes.

Scale free networks can be found in many situations such as protein interaction, traffic and social networks   


## Correlation networks

Given two vectors v~i~ and v~j~, the pearson correlation is given as 

$$\rho_{i,j} = \frac{v_{i}.v_{j}}{||v_{i}||.||v_{j}||}$$

In practice, a set of *N* samples and *G* genes gives a *GXG* matrix of pairwise gene correlations.
Other correlations measures may be the Spearman or the Kendall correlation coefficient.

Example: Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Anaylsis

Limitations:

   - Correlations because of common regulators: g -> j -> k translates into g -> k
   - Limited sample sizes may produce correlations that are not significant.
   
## Information theory based networks

The mutual information between two variables is defined as

$$MI[X,Y] = \sum_{x_{i}, y_{i}}P(x_i, y_i)log\frac{P(x_i,y_i)}{P(x_i)P(y_i)}$$
With P being the probability functions of the variables.
The mutual information is a measure for the dependency of one gene on the other.

Examples: ARACNe, MRNET and CLR

Limitations:

   - computationally expensive
   - sometimes sensitive to noise

## Regression based networks

regression based networks calculate the edge weight based on a regression model

$$x_{gi} = \sum_{i\neq g}w_jx_{ij}+\epsilon_{i}$$

The regression formula gives directed gene regulator networks.

Examples: TIGRESS and GENIE3

Limitations:

   - Directed networks
   - computationally expensive
   - require a sufficient number of samples
   
## Gaussian Graphical Models

this approach uses multivariate normal distributions (Gaussians) described by

$$p(x|m,\Sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi|\Sigma}}exp[-\frac12(x-m)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-m)]$$
To determin the edge weights the partial correlation matrix is used. The *partial correlation* between two genes is the correlation that remains if the effect of all other genes is removed.

Limitations:

   - Does not work on non normal data
   - Assumes a linear regulation between genes
   - Needs a sufficiently high number of samples.

## Bayesian Networks

![Bayesian networks. posterior probabilities in a sample can be calculated using the given network](Images/bayesian2.png){height=1.5cm}

- Limitations
   - computationally expensive, do not scale well
   - network structure difficult to determin
   

## Dynamic Bayesian Networks

![Example of a Dynamic Bayesian Network with four nodes: static representation (with cycles) on the left, and unrolled dynamic representation on the right.](Images/dynbayesian.png)

Limitations

   - extremely computational expensive

   - Assumption of a linear dynamic kinetics - patiularly time points

## Differential equations

Differential equation models are described by the function
$$\frac{dX}{dt}=f(x,\Theta, u(t), t)$$
with x being the gene expression, $\Theta$ a set of parameters, u(t) a set of external signals, and the time t.

- Idea: log transform p(k) and k

- $log(p(k)) \sim -\lambda log(k)$

- The correlation coefficient squared ($r^2$) can be used as index to quantify the goodness of fit

- In reality, one would chose $\beta = 1,2,3,...,n$ and calculate $r^2$ for each $\beta$. 

- A $\beta$ leading to an $r^2$ of larger than 0.85 would be chosen

## Network concepts - Gene Segnificance

Gene significance denotes the significance of a gene for a given scientific question. In general it can be calculated by:

$$GS_i = -log(pvalue_i)$$

The only assumption is that $GS_i = 0$ denotes nodes that are not significant for a given process.

However, $GS_i$ could also be an indicator that equals 1 if prior knowledge suggests that node i is known to be important and 0 otherwise.


## The topological overlap dissimilarity is used as input of hierarchical clustering

What is the topological overlap ?

The topological overlap describes how many neihgbours are shared between two nodes:


$$TOM_{ij} = \frac{\sum{a_{iu}a_{uj}}+a_{ij}}{min(k_i, k_j) + 1 - a_{ij}}$$

The TOM based distance is calculated by

$$DistTOM_{ij} = 1 - TOM_{ij}$$

## Intramodular Connectivity

Intramodular connectivity kIN with respect to a given module (say the Blue module) is defined as the sum of adjacencies with the members of the module.

For unweighted networks=number of direct links to intramodular nodes

For weighted networks= sum of connection strengths to intramodular nodes

$$kIN_i^{module} = \sum_{j \in module}a_{ij}$$

## Module significance

The module significance is the mean gene significance of the members of the module

The module significance measure can be used to address a major goal of gene network analysis: the identification of biologically significant modules or pathways.

# Example

# Putting modules into biologic context

## Unsupervised co-expression analysis

## Supervised co-expression analysis

- Modules are predefined based on pathways, GO-terms, etc.

- The workflow is the same, except for the clustering and module detection which is replaced by the module definition step

- The network concepts (intramodular connectivity, adjacency, density) are the same

- Supervised co-expression analysis mostly compares several networks

# Conclusion

## Take home message

We have implemented several algorithms able to deduce gene regulatory networks from given data, provided the sample size is large enough.
